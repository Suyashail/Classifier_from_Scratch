# Classifier_from_Scratch

An image classifier is created from scratch using Fully Connected Layers. The model has 2 hidden layers and uses ReLU activation and MSE loss function.

The dataset is created by making a subset of the CiFAR10 dataset to include only cat and dog images. The aim of the classifier is to correctly classify the two classes of images.

The model can be directly run without any changes.
